# Roadmap for NBS-Predictor-MVP

This document outlines the planned development path for the NBS-Predictor-MVP. Our aim is to develop a functional and efficient tool for forecasting the net basin supply (NBS) six months into the future using NOAA forecast data. The roadmap is a living document and is subject to change as the project evolves.

## Current Objectives

As of the current state of the project, our objectives are:

- **Develop the basic framework**: Create a robust architecture that allows for easy integration of NOAA data and scalability for future enhancements.
- **Module Development**:
  - **Data Acquisition Module**: Develop the module responsible for downloading and formatting the NOAA forecast data.
  - **Predictive Modeling**: Build and validate initial predictive models focused on statistical and machine learning techniques that best utilize the available data.
  - **Post-processing Visualization**: Design and implement a visualization interface for the forecast data and predictive results.
- **Initial Documentation**: Draft the basic documentation necessary for users to understand and interact with the tool.

## Upcoming Work

The following items represent the immediate areas of focus:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Tools and scripts to prepare raw data for analysis.
2. **Model Selection and Implementation**: Iterative process of selecting predictive models and refining them.
3. **System Testing**: Rigorous testing of the complete system to validate forecast accuracy and reliability.

## Future Plans

- **Model Enhancements**: Investigate and integrate more sophisticated models or ensemble approaches to improve forecast reliability.
- **User Interface**: Develop a simple user interface that allows users to specify parameters and run forecasts without deep knowledge of the underlying system.
- **Automation**: Establish automated pipelines for data retrieval and processing, model running, and output generation.
- **Community Features**: Enable features that allow the community to contribute data, share forecasts, and collaborate on model improvement.

## Long-term Vision

- **Integration with Real-time Data Streams**: Enable the system to ingest real-time data to provide up-to-date forecasts more frequently.
- **Collaborations and Partnerships**: Work with academic and industry partners and stakeholders (e.g. USACE) to improve and deploy the NBS-Predictor.
